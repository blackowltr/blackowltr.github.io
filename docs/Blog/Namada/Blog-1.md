Stride has embarked on a collaborative effort with Namada to pioneer onchain data protection solutions integrated seamlessly with Cosmos and beyond.

#### Advancing Data Protection for Cosmos and Beyond

Namada stands out as a multi-chain, multi-asset data protection network that extends its support across Cosmos, Ethereum, and other prominent blockchain ecosystems. In recent months, Namada has rolled out eligibility criteria for an upcoming airdrop and conducted rigorous testing on multiple testnets.

Anticipated for launch later this year, Namada promises to revolutionize data protection with its innovative approach.

#### Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) Empowered by Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Technology

At the heart of Namada's offering is the Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP), leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to empower users. This technology allows users to confidentially send any token into Namada's shielded set via Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), while simultaneously earning rewards for shielding their assets. As the number of assets protected within the shielded set grows, Namada's data protection guarantees strengthen, benefiting all participants in the ecosystem.

#### Enhanced Data Privacy Across Chains

Namada's MASP not only facilitates the secure holding and transaction of tokens and NFTs but also ensures users can interact with applications on transparent blockchains without compromising their personal data. This capability includes creating new accounts (e.g., generating new addresses for any IBC token transfers) while maintaining robust privacy protections.

#### Public Good and Sustainable Data Protection

Namada views data protection as a public good, essential for enhancing the security of assets across its ecosystem. The protocol funds this public good through the automatic distribution of NAM shielding rewards to those safeguarding governance tokens within the pool.

#### Stride's Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Their Role in Data Protection

Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) offered by Stride play a pivotal role in augmenting data protection within Namada's framework. These tokens are expected to garner support within Namada's governance community for their efficiency in rewarding unstaked tokens, surpassing traditional staking rewards.

##### Comparative Analysis of Tokens' Efficiency

| Token   | Hurdle Rate (%) | Use Case          |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| TIA     | 15              | DeFi              |
| stTIA   | 0               | DeFi              |

##### Understanding the Advantage of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)

The example of Celestia's TIA token underscores the drawbacks of traditional staking models in DeFi, where a hurdle rate of 15% can deter liquidity. In contrast, LSTs boast a hurdle rate of zero, making them more attractive for liquidity-sensitive protocols.

#### Stride's Commitment to Security and Economic Stability

Security remains paramount for Stride, bolstered by interchain security provisions from Cosmos Hub and economic security derived from all staked ATOM. With current market dynamics, Stride boasts approximately $3 billion in economic security, underpinning its robust operational framework.

Furthermore, Stride's blockchain architecture incorporates advanced IBC speed limits, custom-designed to mitigate risks associated with large-scale withdrawals during critical events, thereby ensuring operational resilience.

#### Conclusion: Enabling Unprecedented Data Protection

As Namada prepares for its imminent launch, Stride's LSTs are poised to provide substantial liquidity to the shielded pools. Users can securely hold their tokens within these pools, earning transaction fees and potentially unlocking NAM shielding rewards in addition to stake rewards.

In summary, Namada's innovative use of zero-knowledge technology combined with Stride's Liquid Staking Tokens sets a new standard for data protection in the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond. This collaboration not only enhances privacy but also ensures sustainable and robust security measures for digital assets in an increasingly interconnected blockchain landscape.
